<h1>Solo</h1>
	<body> <p> Playing solo is like having every man for themself. Although it is 
	more difficult, I prefer to play solo rather than playing in a squad because I enjoy
	the challenge. With the great variety of of places to find loot and fend for yourself
	makes the experience have a sense of thrill; keeping you on the edge of your seat.</p>
