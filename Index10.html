	<title>Loot Island</title>
	
	<h1> <p style="color:purple;"> Loot Island has so many different 
	possible locations where players can settle and load up on loot. The terrain is 
	a similar concept to that in "Minecraft" so you can expect to see a lot of trees,
	mountains, rivers, bridges, and towns/villages. Upon choosing which location to 
	settle and gather loot, keep into consideration that some places are more popular
	than others. Once the game has started and players are starting to be eliminated by
	one another, a storm starts to settle in bringing the players still alive closer and
	closer together. Forcing the players into a smaller surface area of the island makes
	the game more thrilling and active. Players that do not make it out of the storm in 
	time will be eliminated from the game.</p>
