<h1>About Fortnite</h1>
	 <body> <p style="color:blue;"> Fortnite is the next big thing in the world of gaming. 
Offering to people of all ages, available on PC, Xbox, and Playstation.
Equipped with two game modes: save the world mode and Battle Royale game mode. 
This game has a similar survival concept to the movie "The Hunger Games" but the terrain 
is in more relation to the video game "Minecraft". There are 100 players in each round;
each of which are dropped from a bus flown by an air balloon. Players then pick a location
on the map where they want to settle and gather materials to fight for survival. 
The object of the game is to be the last one standing.</p>
